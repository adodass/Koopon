# Koopon Frontend


KOOPON provides service providers and manufacturers with a way to reward their clients in a cost-effective manner as well as provide coupon holders with the option of trading these coupons. It is a win-win situation. Service providers have a way of keeping customers coming back, and customers/clients get rewarded and can trade for other coupons they desire.
To enable providers and manufacturers reward their clients, we provide a way for these businesses to mint coupons created as NFTs, which can be sent to customers via Whatsapp, exchanged, traded, bid etc...

KOOPON is built on MINTBASE API enabling any business create, mint and list NFTs.
